I used React with Typescript and used vite as build system. The project is a simple inventory managment system where you can:

- main - production ready envirnment where the application is ready for customers.

### Packages 
- Axios - for maing http request to the backend

### Out standing 
- Authentication - the inventory solution need authentication to secure the data trnasations to make sure the right people have access to the right resouces
